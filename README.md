# CogniVault_AI-Agent

CogniVault AI Agent Prototype is a conceptual demonstration of an AI agent that uses a SQL database (via SQLAlchemy) as its “brain” for storing tasks, memories, and logs. The agent processes tasks by “consulting” a simulated language model and persists outcomes for future reference. In a production system, you might replace the dummy language model with a cutting-edge LLM (or a suite of models) and expand the database schema and orchestration logic.

## Disclaimer

This is a conceptual prototype meant to illustrate one way to “ground” an AI agent in persistent storage. In production you will likely want to add robust error handling, security (for database access and API keys), comprehensive testing, and integration with real language model APIs or modules.

## Features

- **Persistent Storage:**  
  Uses SQLAlchemy to persist tasks, memories, and logs in a SQL database.

- **REST API:**  
  A Flask-based API to create new tasks and retrieve task, memory, and log data.

- **Background Task Processing:**  
  A background worker continuously polls for pending tasks, processes them using a dummy language model, updates task statuses, and stores results.

- **Robust Logging:**  
  Logs agent operations to both the console and a rotating log file (`ai_agent.log`).

- **Configurable Settings:**  
  Easily configure database URL, polling interval, server host/port, and debug mode via environment variables.

## Use Cases & Examples

### 1. Automated Task Processing
**Example:**  
A team uses CogniVault to automatically analyze incoming business tasks. Each task (e.g., “Analyze user engagement trends for Q4 and suggest improvements”) is processed, and the generated analysis is stored in the agent's memory. This enables the team to review past analyses and track the evolution of business insights over time.

### 2. Persistent AI Memory
**Example:**  
An AI assistant integrated with CogniVault can reference previous tasks and analyses stored in its “memory” to provide context-aware responses. For instance, if asked about previous user engagement metrics, the assistant can retrieve logged insights and provide a detailed history.

### 3. Logging & Auditing for Decision Support
**Example:**  
Organizations can use CogniVault to maintain an audit trail of all automated decisions and analyses. This is useful for compliance, troubleshooting, or further refining the AI agent’s performance by analyzing trends in the logs.

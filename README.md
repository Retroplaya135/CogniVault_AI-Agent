# CogniVault_AI-Agent

CogniVault AI Agent Prototype is a conceptual demonstration of an AI agent that uses a SQL database (via SQLAlchemy) as its “brain” for storing tasks, memories, and logs. The agent processes tasks by “consulting” a simulated language model and persists outcomes for future reference. In a production system, you might replace the dummy language model with a cutting-edge LLM (or a suite of models) and expand the database schema and orchestration logic.

## Disclaimer

This is a conceptual prototype meant to illustrate one way to “ground” an AI agent in persistent storage. In production you will likely want to add robust error handling, security (for database access and API keys), comprehensive testing, and integration with real language model APIs or modules.

## Features

- **Persistent Storage:**  
  Uses SQLite (via SQLAlchemy) to store tasks, memories, and logs in a structured and queryable format.

- **Task Processing:**  
  Processes tasks by generating simulated responses using a dummy language model function (`generate_response`).
